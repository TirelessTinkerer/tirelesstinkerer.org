I want to build a local LLM that can read my pdfs and I can ask it question. Here are some links I found. https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1foct9g/paid_or_free_what_is_the_best_local_pc_llm_rag/, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41968366.  For example https://msty.app/ looks pretty neat.
