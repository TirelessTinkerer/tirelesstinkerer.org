And this doesn't work. Notice the quotes in the last line. 
```
curl \
  -u username:token \
  -X PUT \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/tirelesstinkerer/tirelesstinkerer.org/contents/content/ublog/2021-01-05_19-50.md \
  -d '{"message":"new file using github api","content":"$(base64 /tmp/filename.md -w 0)"}'
```

Got stuck for quite a while, and found the reason from [here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/211613/combine-curl-and-base64-into-one-command).
