Fun but meaningless endevors up till now this year:
1. Self hosting immich server. Lots of data juggling, but ended up not using it.
2. Self hosting vaultwarden. Lots of effort on getting https to work. But ended up using apple password.
3. Self host gmail backup and viewer system. Got mbsync to work, but dovecot not working.
